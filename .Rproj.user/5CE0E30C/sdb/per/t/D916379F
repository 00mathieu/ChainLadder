Three approaches to forecasting demographic processes are extrapolation, expectation (individual-level birth expectations or population-level opinions of experts), and theory-based structural modelling involving exogenous variables. Models include 0-3 factors (age, period and cohort). Decomposition and disaggregation are also used in multistate models, including macrosimulation and microsimulation. Forecasting demographic change is difficult; accuracy depends on the particular situation or trends, but it is not clear when a method will perform best. Estimates of uncertainty (model-based ex ante error, expert-opinion-based ex ante error, and ex post error) differ; uncertainty estimation is highly uncertain. Probabilistic population forecasts are based on stochastic population renewal or random scenarios. The approaches to population forecasting, demographic process forecasting and error estimation are closely linked. Complementary methods that combine approaches are increasingly employed. The paper summarises developments, assesses progress and considers the future.},\nauthor = {Booth, Heather},\ndoi = {10.1016/j.ijforecast.2006.04.001},\nfile = {:home/hyndman/Mendeley/Booth - 2006 - Demographic forecasting 1980 to 2005 in review.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {0169-2070},\njournal = {International Journal of Forecasting},\nkeywords = {Demographic modelling,Mor,Population forecasting,revart},\nnumber = {3},\npages = {547--581},\ntitle = {{Demographic forecasting: 1980 to 2005 in review}},\nvolume = {22},\nyear = {2006}\n}\n@book{RS05,\naddress = {New York},\nauthor = {Ramsay, James O and Silverman, Bernard W},\nedition = {2nd},\npublisher = {Springer-Verlag},\ntitle = {{Functional Data Analysis}},\nyear = {2005}\n}\n@article{LC92,\nabstract = {Time series methods are used to make long-run forecasts, with confidence intervals, of age-specific mortality in the United States from 1990 to 2065. First, the logs of the age-specific death rates are modeled as a linear function of an unobserved period-specific intensity index, with parameters depending on age. This model is fit to the matrix of U.S. death rates, 1933 to 1987, using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method; it accounts for almost all the variance over time in age-specific death rates as a group. Whereas eo has risen at a decreasing rate over the century and has decreasing variability, k(t) declines at a roughly constant rate and has roughly constant variability, facilitating forecasting. k(t), which indexes the intensity of mortality, is next modeled as a time series (specifically, a random walk with drift) and forecast. The method performs very well on within-sample forecasts, and the forecasts are insensitive to reductions in the length of the base period from 90 to 30 years; some instability appears for base periods of 10 or 20 years, however. Forecasts of age-specific rates are derived from the forecasts of k, and other life table variables are derived and presented. These imply an increase of 10.5 years in life expectancy to 86.05 in 2065 (sexes combined), with a confidence band of plus 3.9 or minus 5.6 years, including uncertainty concerning the estimated trend. Whereas 46\\% now survive to age 80, by 2065 46\\% will survive to age 90. Of the gains forecast for person-years lived over the life cycle from now until 2065, 74\\% will occur at age 65 and over. These life expectancy forecasts are substantially lower than direct time series forecasts of eo, and have far narrower confidence bands; however, they are substantially higher than the forecasts of the Social Security Administration's Office of the Actuary.},\nannote = {File 0881},\nauthor = {Lee, Ronald D and Carter, Lawrence R},\ndoi = {10.2307/2290201},\nfile = {:home/hyndman/Mendeley/Lee, Carter - 1992 - Modeling and forecasting U.S. mortality.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {01621459},\njournal = {Journal of the American Statistical Association},\nkeywords = {Demography,forecast,life expectancy,mortality},\nnumber = {419},\npages = {659--671},\npublisher = {American Statistical Association},\ntitle = {{Modeling and forecasting U.S. mortality}},\nvolume = {87},\nyear = {1992}\n}\n@article{Bongaarts05a,\nannote = {File 1437},\nauthor = {Bongaarts, John},\nfile = {:home/hyndman/Mendeley/Bongaarts - 2005 - Long-Range Trends in Adult Mortality Models and Projection Methods.pdf:pdf},\njournal = {Demography},\nnumber = {1},\npages = {23--49},\ntitle = {{Long-Range Trends in Adult Mortality: Models and Projection Methods}},\nvolume = {42},\nyear = {2005}\n}\n@article{CDD05,\nannote = {File 1503},\nauthor = {Czado, Claudia and Delwarde, Antoine and Denuit, Michael},\njournal = {Insurance: Mathematics and Economics},\nkeywords = {Expected remaining lifetimes,MCMC,Poisson regression,Projected lifetables},\npages = {260--284},\ntitle = {{Bayesian Poisson log-bilinear mortality projections}},\nvolume = {36},\nyear = {2005}\n}\n@article{Impicciatore2011,\nauthor = {Impicciatore, Roberto and Billari, Francesco C},\ndoi = {10.4054/DemRes.2011.24.29},\nfile = {:home/hyndman/Mendeley/Impicciatore, Billari - 2011 - MAPLES A general method for the estimation of age profiles from standard demographic surveys (with an application to fertility).pdf:pdf},\nissn = {1435-9871},\njournal = {Demographic Research},\nmonth = may,\npages = {719--748},\ntitle = {{MAPLES: A general method for the estimation of age profiles from standard demographic surveys (with an application to fertility)}},\nvolume = {24},\nyear = {2011}\n}\n@article{SR05a,\nannote = {File 1564},\nauthor = {Schoen, Robert and Canudas-Romo, Vladimir},\ndoi = {10.4054/DemRes.2005.13.5},\nfile = {:home/hyndman/Mendeley/Schoen, Canudas-Romo - 2005 - Changing mortality and average cohort life expectancy.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {1435-9871},\njournal = {Demographic Research},\nmonth = oct,\npages = {117--142},\ntitle = {{Changing mortality and average cohort life expectancy}},\nvolume = {13},\nyear = {2005}\n}\n@article{Haberman2011,\nauthor = {Haberman, Steven and Renshaw, Arthur E},\ndoi = {10.1016/j.insmatheco.2010.09.003},\nfile = {:home/hyndman/Mendeley/Haberman, Renshaw - 2011 - A comparative study of parametric mortality projection models.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {01676687},\njournal = {Insurance: Mathematics and Economics},\nkeywords = {binomial response models,mortality forecasting},\nmonth = jan,\nnumber = {1},\npages = {35--55},\npublisher = {Elsevier B.V.},\ntitle = {{A comparative study of parametric mortality projection models}},\nvolume = {48},\nyear = {2011}\n}\n@unpublished{Hunsinger2010,\nauthor = {Hunsinger, Eddie},\nfile = {:home/hyndman/Mendeley/Hunsinger - 2010 - An expert-based stochastic population forecast for Alaska.pdf:pdf},\nnumber = {September},\npages = {1--23},\ntitle = {{An expert-based stochastic population forecast for Alaska}},\nyear = {2010}\n}\n@misc{Currie2006,\nauthor = {Currie, Iain D},\nfile = {:home/hyndman/Mendeley/Currie - 2006 - Smoothing and forecasting mortality rates with P-splines.pdf:pdf},\ntitle = {{Smoothing and forecasting mortality rates with P-splines}},\nyear = {2006}\n}\n@article{Kedem2008,\nabstract = {The authors propose a semiparametric approach to modeling and forecasting age-specific mortality in the United States.

The model decomposes the evolution of TFR into three phases: pre-transition high fertility, the fertility transition, and post-transition low fertility. The model for the fertility decline builds on the United Nations Population Division's current deterministic projection methodology, which assumes that fertility will eventually fall below replacement level. It models the decline in TFR as the sum of two logistic functions that depend on the current TFR level, and a random term. A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to project future TFR based on both the country's TFR history and the pattern of all countries. It is estimated from United Nations estimates of past TFR in all countries using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The post-transition low fertility phase is modeled using an autoregressive model, in which long-term TFR projections converge toward and oscillate around replacement level. The method is evaluated using out-of-sample projections for the period since 1980 and the period since 1995, and is found to be well calibrated.},\nauthor = {Alkema, Leontine and Raftery, Adrian E and Gerland, Patrick and Clark, Samuel J and Pelletier, Fran\\c{c}ois and Buettner, Thomas and Heilig, Gerhard K},\ndoi = {10.1007/s13524-011-0040-5},\nfile = {:home/hyndman/Mendeley/Alkema et al. - 2011 - Probabilistic projections of the total fertility rate for all countries.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {0070-3370},\njournal = {Demography},\nmonth = aug,\nnumber = {3},\npages = {815--39},\npmid = {21748544},\ntitle = {{Probabilistic projections of the total fertility rate for all countries.}},\nvolume = {48},\nyear = {2011}\n}\n@article{BT08,\nauthor = {Booth, Heather and Tickle, Leonie},\njournal = {Annals of Actuarial Science},\nnumber = {1-2},\npages = {3--43},\ntitle = {{Mortality modelling and forecasting: A review of methods}},\nvolume = {3},\nyear = {2008}\n}\n@unpublished{Debonneuil2010,\nabstract = {The Lee Carter modelling framework is widely used because of its simplicity and robustness despite its inability to model specific cohort effects.

However, we identify problems with the robustness of parameter estimates under the RH model, calling into question its suitability for forecasting. A different ex- tension to the CBD model that allows not only for a cohort effect, but also for a quadratic age effect, while ranking below the other models in terms of the BIC, exhibits parameter stability across different time periods for both datasets. This model also shows, for both datasets, that there have been approximately linear improvements over time in mortality rates at all ages, but that the improvements have been greater at lower ages than at higher ages, and that there are significant cohort effects.},\nauthor = {Cairns, Andrew J G and Blake, David and Dowd, Kevin and Goughlan, Guy D and Epstein, David and Ong, Alen and Balevich, Igor},\nfile = {:home/hyndman/Mendeley/Cairns et al. -

Such forecasts would be an input to the production of probabilistic population projections for all countries, which is currently being considered by the United Nations. To evaluate the method, we conducted an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment, fitting the model to the data from 1950-1995 and using the estimated model to forecast for the subsequent 10 years. The 10-year predictions had a mean absolute error of about 1 year, about 40 \\% less than the current UN methodology. The probabilistic forecasts were calibrated in the sense that, for example, the 80 \\% prediction intervals contained the truth about 80 \\% of the time. We illustrate our method with results from Madagascar (a typical country with steadily improving life expectancy), Latvia (a country that has had a mortality crisis), and Japan (a leading country). We also show aggregated results for South Asia, a region with eight countries. Free, publicly available R software packages called bayesLife and bayesDem are available to implement the method.},\nauthor = {Raftery, Adrian E and Chunn, Jennifer L and Gerland, Patrick and Sev\\v{c}\\'{\\i}kov\\'{a}, Hana},\njournal = {Demography},\npages = {777--801},\npmid = {23494599},\ntitle = {{Bayesian Probabilistic Projections of Life Expectancy for All Countries.}},\nvolume = {50},\nyear = {2013}\n}\n\n@article{HBY13,\nauthor = {Hyndman, Rob J and Booth, Heather and Yasmeen, Farah},\njournal = {Demography},\nnumber = {1},\npages = {261--283},\ntitle = {{Coherent mortality forecasting: the product-ratio method with functional time series models}},\ntype = {Working paper},\nvolume = {50},\nyear = {2013}\n}\n\n\n@book{Chiang1984,\nauthor = {Chiang, Chin Long},\npublisher = {Robert E.

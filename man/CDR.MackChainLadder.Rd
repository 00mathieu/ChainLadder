\details{
Merz & Wuethrich (2008) derived analytic formulae for the standard deviation of the claims development result after one year assuming:
\itemize{
  \item{
    The opening reserves were set using the pure chain ladder model 
    (no tail)
    }
  \item{
    Claims develop in the year according to the assumptions underlying
    Mack's model
    }
  \item{
    Reserves are set after one year using the pure chain ladder model 
    (no tail) 
    }
  }
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with various ultimate and one-year statistics of the 
claims development result.
